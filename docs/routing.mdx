# Routing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers our routing system using TanStack Router, focusing on type-safe routing and code organization.

## Route Structure

Our routes are organized by feature domains:

```ts
src/router/
├── index.tsx        # Router initialization
├── types.ts         # Route type utilities
├── routes.ts        # Route composition
└── routes/
    ├── public.routes.ts    # Public routes (home, changelog, etc.)
    ├── auth.routes.ts      # Authentication routes
    └── protected.routes.ts # Protected routes (dashboard, etc.)
```

### Route Utilities

We use a type-safe utility for creating lazy-loaded routes:

```ts
// src/router/types.ts
export const createLazyRoute = <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(options: {
  getParentRoute: () => typeof rootRoute | ReturnType<typeof createRoute>,
  path?: string,
  id?: string,
  component: () => Promise<{ default: React.ComponentType<T> }>,
}) => {
  return createRoute({
    ...options,
    component: lazyRouteComponent(options.component),
  })
}
```

### Feature-Based Route Organization

Routes are organized by feature for better maintainability:

```ts
// src/router/routes/public.routes.ts
export const publicRoute = createLazyRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: 'public',
  component: () => import('../../components/layout/public-layout'),
})

export const indexRoute = createLazyRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => publicRoute,
  path: '/',
  component: () => import('../../views/home-page'),
})

// Export route tree
export const publicRoutes = publicRoute.addChildren([
  indexRoute,
  // ... other routes
])
```

### Route Composition

Routes are combined in the main routes file:

```ts
// src/router/routes.ts
import { publicRoutes } from './routes/public.routes'
import { authRoutes } from './routes/auth.routes'
import { protectedRoutes } from './routes/protected.routes'

export const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  publicRoutes,
  authRoutes,
  ...protectedRoutes,
])

// Re-export for use in components
export * from './routes/public.routes'
export * from './routes/auth.routes'
export * from './routes/protected.routes'
```

## Using Routes in Components

Routes can be imported and used in a type-safe way:

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { indexRoute, signInRoute } from '@/router/routes'

export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to={indexRoute.to}>Home</Link>
      <Link to={signInRoute.to}>Sign In</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

## Protected Routes

Protected routes are automatically guarded:

```tsx
// src/components/layout/protected-layout.tsx
import { Navigate } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { useAuth } from '@/features/auth/contexts/auth-context'

export default function ProtectedLayout() {
  const { user } = useAuth()

  if (!user) {
    return <Navigate to="/auth/signin" />
  }

  return <Outlet />
}
```

## Route Features

Our routing system provides:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for routes and parameters
- **Lazy Loading**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
- **Feature Organization**: Routes grouped by domain
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-based access control
- **Centralized Exports**: All routes available from a single import
- **Maintainable Structure**: Each feature manages its own routes

## Best Practices

1. **Route Organization**:
   - Keep routes close to their features
   - Use the `createLazyRoute` utility for consistency
   - Export both individual routes and route trees

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Use route objects instead of string literals
   - Leverage TypeScript for route parameters
   - Import routes from the central `routes.ts`

3. **Code Splitting**:
   - Use lazy loading for all route components
   - Keep layouts and pages in separate files
   - Use dynamic imports for route components

4. **Navigation**:
   - Use `Link` components with route objects
   - Handle protected routes at the layout level
   - Use `Navigate` for programmatic navigation
