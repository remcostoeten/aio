# Mock Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the current mock implementation of the authentication and user management system, and what needs to be changed when moving to production.

## Current Mock Setup

### User Data
- Location: `src/server/db/index.ts`
- Purpose: Simulates a database with in-memory user storage
- Current limitations: Data is reset on server restart

### Authentication Flow
1. Registration (`src/features/auth/services/auth-service.ts`)
   - Simulates network delay
   - Checks for existing users
   - Creates new user without password hashing
   - Stores user in mock database

2. Session Management
   - Currently using localStorage (not secure)
   - No real token management
   - Basic cookie-based auth check in middleware

## Production Migration Checklist

### Database Implementation
- [ ] Install and configure Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Uncomment and update schema in `src/server/db/schema/user.ts`
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Remove mock database

### Authentication Security
- [ ] Implement password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- [ ] Set up JWT or session-based authentication
- [ ] Configure secure cookie handling
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### User Management
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Add account deletion
- [ ] Set up user roles and permissions

### API Security
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Add request sanitization
